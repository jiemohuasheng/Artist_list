In the near term, I would love to know all the co-workers and get familiar with the work culture. At the same time, I will try to develop myself and learn as much as I can about the role and become a good addition for the company. In the longer term, I want to become an expert/leader in the area of greatest need within my role and help other people to develop.



Describe the most difficult programming problem you have solved recently. And share the solution if possible. *
While working on the Social Networking project, I was stuck on the same task for hours and was unable to find any solutions. I was creating the timeline for the users and I found that I was not able to show the content properly. I decided to write down the problem and all the possible solutions. Finally, I used 'sets' to remove the multiple entries of the data as 'sets' can not store duplicate values. Then I converted 'set' into a 'list' as 'lists' can be indexed, and sort the data according to the requirements.  In the end I was able to display the content properly on the user timeline.
